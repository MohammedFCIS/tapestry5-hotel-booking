        <p>This is the Sign In page (Signin.tml/Signin.java).
        </p>
        <p>You were sent here because you requested a page that requires you to
        authenticate (log in). In this app, all pages require you to log in
        except those whose Java class is annotated with @AnonymousAccess.
        We've created a "component request filter" (AuthenticationFilter.java,
        in this case) that enforces that rule. It redirected you to this
        page because it did not find the
        the @AnonymousAccess annotation in the Java class of the page you
        requested.
        </p>
        <p>See
        <a href="https://tapestry.apache.org/security.html">here</a> for
        more information on this and other security approaches.
        </p>
        <p>One final note: the name of the page you requested was appended to
        the URL of this page, and it will also be passed along when you submit
        this form, or when you click the Register link, so that eventually,
        after you have registered and/or logged in, you'll be taken back to the
        page you wanted to go to.
